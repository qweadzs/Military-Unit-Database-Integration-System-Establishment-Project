# Military-Unit-Database-Integration-System-Establishment-Project

## Introduction

+ 3th grade 1st semester Capstone Design Project(2019/3 ~ 6)
+ When in the army, things were often delayed because they did not know the location or heavy equipment number of other soldiers. In addition, in order to find the number of people currently available when an emergency occurred, one had to search the books or read the bulletin boards, and it had to be uncomfortable in another file to find out the existence of various soldiers' long articles due to military inspection. This led to the need to integrate almost all information about soldiers and to see at a glance the current status and situation of soldiers. Therefore, tables were made that could easily be used for personal information, such as the soldier's physical condition, vacation status, position, work, and physical strength, as well as information on the unit's convenience facilities or the unit's unit's address. If such a database system is established, efficient unit operation will be possible.
